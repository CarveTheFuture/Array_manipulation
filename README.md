# Array_manipulation
In this repository, arrays are created and manipulated to demonstrate what can be done in Python.

NumPy
NumPy is an extremely useful library for doing mathematics in python. It is very fast due to the fact that it leverages C code to do computationally-intensive operations. It has built-in libraries for doing many linear algebra opperations.

Goals
Understand the difference between an array (size = (n,)) and a matrix (size = (n,m))
Understand how numpy slicing opperations work
Use numpy to perform linear algebra opperations like matrix multiplication
