    "A Markov Chain is a simple model for a system that transitions between states, where there is some randomness involved in the transitions. If, for example, the system has three states (on, off, and idle, for example), then the probabilities from transitioning from one state to another can be encoded as a three by three matrix of probabilities with some simple properties, this is called a stochastic matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of entering a certain state depends only on the last state occupied and the transition probabilities in the stochastic matrix, not on the entire history of states. This is called the markov property, and it makes Markov Chains particularly simple and appealing models.\n",
